This project is the implementation of a simple election algorithm for circular unidirectional graphs

1) select the `Circular Simple Election` project
2) simulation > generate nodes > set the number of nodes and the distribution model > choose the NodeImpl for Node implementation > set the connectivity to static > No interference > No mobility > reliable delivery > click OK
3) Global > Link Circular
4) right click any node and click Start Election
5) start the simulation and
